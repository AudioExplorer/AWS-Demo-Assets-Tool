## Keep Your AWS S3 Demo Assets Live: Automating Presigned URLs with Node.js

### TL;DR
You work with audio (or any media) all the time and have **demo assets** stored securely on Amazon S3.  
You want to load these into your apps or SDK demos ‚Äî but your **presigned URLs keep expiring**.  

*Update:* The CLI now also supports uploading files or directories to your S3 demo‚Äëassets bucket and listing bucket contents ‚Äî all with one command.

This little Node.js CLI lets you:
- generate presigned URLs for your S3 bucket (`demo-assets/`)
- save them in a JSON file for easy import into any project  
- refresh them anytime with a single command

Let‚Äôs walk through how to build it.

---

## Use Case

You might have something like:
```
s3://audioshake/demo-assets/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Chupe-Jaae-English.mp4
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Vocal-Demo.wav
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Guitar-Solo.mp3
```

These are your demo media files ‚Äî used for testing APIs, web players, or internal demos.

You could manually create a presigned URL each time, but that‚Äôs tedious.  
Instead, you‚Äôll use this lightweight CLI to generate a simple `demo-assets.json`:

```json
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "src": "https://audioshake.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/demo-assets/Vocal-Demo.wav?...",
      "title": "Vocal-Demo.wav",
      "format": "audio/wav",
      "expiry": "2025-10-14T09:45:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now your local or web app can fetch demo assets reliably ‚Äî and when URLs expire, just rerun `create-demo-assets`.

---

## Step 1: Configure AWS

Make sure you have the AWS CLI set up with a profile that can read from your bucket:

```bash
aws configure --profile admin
# Region: us-east-1
# Output: json
```

You can verify:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile admin
aws s3 ls s3://audioshake/demo-assets/ --profile admin
```

Ensure your IAM policy allows `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` for your demo‚Äëassets prefix.

---

## Step 2: Install the tool

Install with our NPX package:
```bash
npx create-demo-assets 
```

Then install the dependencies globally and creates a config file that stores your bucket information and which AWS profile to use.
```bash
# Run setup again to change the config
create-demo-assets --setup
```

---

## Step 3: Run It

From any directory:
```bash
create-demo-assets
```

It will:
- list all objects in your S3 folder  
- generate presigned URLs (default 12‚Äëhour expiry)  
- save `demo-assets.json` in your current working directory  

---

```
üîç Listing objects in s3://audioshake/demo-assets/ ...
demo-assets.json created with 8 assets
```

## Step 4: Upload or List Assets

You can now upload new demo files or check what‚Äôs in your bucket without generating JSON.

Upload a single file:
```bash
create-demo-assets --upload ./song.mp3
```

Upload a directory:
```bash
create-demo-assets --uploadDir ./assets --type=mp3,mp4
```

List all files:
```bash
create-demo-assets --list
```

If you pass `--type`, only matching file extensions are included. Supported formats include mp3, wav, mp4, mov, json, txt, md, and more.

---

## How It Works (Under the Hood)

The script uses the AWS SDK v3:
```js
import { S3Client, ListObjectsV2Command, GetObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";
import { fromIni } from "@aws-sdk/credential-providers";
```

It lists objects, creates presigned URLs via `GetObjectCommand`, and writes them to JSON.

If your bucket has no `LocationConstraint` (the classic us‚Äëeast‚Äë1 case), the CLI automatically signs requests for that region.

The same script now handles uploads and listing via the same S3 client ‚Äî no extra configuration required.

---

## Refreshing URLs

Each URL has a 12‚Äëhour expiry by default.  
When your links expire, just rerun:
```bash
create-demo-assets
```
and it‚Äôll overwrite the old JSON with fresh URLs.

---

## Example Output

```
üîç Listing objects in s3://audioshake/demo-assets/ ...
demo-assets.json created with 8 assets
```

`demo-assets.json` now contains:
```json
{
  "assets": [
    { "src": "...", "title": "Guitar-Solo.mp3", "format": "audio/mpeg", "expiry": "2025-10-14T10:00:00Z" }
  ]
}
```

## Why It‚Äôs Useful
This simple tool bridges your secure S3 assets with live demos or dev environments ‚Äî without exposing buckets or manually generating presigned URLs every time.  

Recent updates make it easier to keep demo assets synchronized: you can upload, list, and regenerate presigned URLs from one CLI.

Perfect for:
- API demos
- Audio/Video SDK previews
- Internal or hackathon projects

**Caution:** Avoid exposing your presigned JSON publicly or using overly long expirations.
